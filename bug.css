The following CSS code snippet causes an unexpected rendering issue in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue stems from the use of `float: left` without a proper clearing mechanism.  If the `div` elements don't perfectly fill a row, subsequent elements might unexpectedly wrap around or overlap.
