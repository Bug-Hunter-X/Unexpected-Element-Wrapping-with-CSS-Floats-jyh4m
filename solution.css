The solution involves adding a clearing mechanism after the floated elements.  There are several ways to do this, here is one using the `clear: both` property:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}

.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
```

Apply the `clearfix` class to a parent container of the floated elements to clear the floats:

```html
<div class="clearfix">
  <div>Element 1</div>
  <div>Element 2</div>
</div>
<div>Next Element</div>
```

This ensures that the 'Next Element' won't wrap unexpectedly.
